# Tic-Tac-Go!
My sample game type of HyperCasual.

# howToPlay
There are only 1 player between clocks rotating at different speeds, and if you touch the screen, if the bullet is sent in the direction that your watch is facing and overlaps a watch, you will switch to the speed, size and position of that watch.

# aboutGame
I started this project about a month ago. The reason I started the project is because I don't like the shared structure. The same thing is available in Unity Assetstore, but the structures we use are not the same. By studying this project, I think you will have a little knowledge of Unity, C # or my coding skills.
